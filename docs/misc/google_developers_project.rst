   1. In the Project name field, type in a name for your project.
   2. In the Project ID field, optionally type in a project ID for your
      project or use the one that the console has created for you. This
      ID must be unique world-wide.
   3. Click the **Create** button and wait for the project to be
      created.
   4. Click on the new project name in the list to start editing the
      project.

3. In the left sidebar, select the **APIs** item below "APIs & auth". A
   list of Google web services appears.
4. Find the **Google+ API** service and set its status to **ON**â€”notice
   that this action moves the service to the top of the list.

      for your app. You can enter multiple origins to use with multiple

      we assume your re:dash instance address is *redash.example.com*:

       https://redash.example.com
